A markdown template for storytelling.


## Prelude

Stories are great teaching aids. They provide a safe setting where people can share an experience that teaches a particular lesson (or group of lessons). People learn best when they're experiencing things. People remember best when feelings get associated with the lessons they're learning. A story can provide a visceral example that gets remembered.


## Start with Why

Why are you telling the story? What's the point you're trying to communicate? Keep the end game in sight throughout the storytelling process.


## Set the Mood

Stories start with a setting. Capture attention and pull the audience into the story world.

* Who are the Characters?
* When & where is the story set?
* How does the protagonist's journey begin?


## Tension

The next part of the story introduces tension. The protagonist must face a struggle that forces them to realize vulnerability. This sets the stage for a lesson to be learned. Introduce the pain here. Share that pain with the audience.



## Turning Point

This is the peak of the protagonist's character arch. This is where the point hits home. The moment they realize that there is a better way to move forward.


## Resolution

Armed with the new lesson learned, the protagonist sets out to change things. The main challenge in the story is addressed, and the outcome is determined. This is where you tie up loose ends and let the audience know that the story is over. Or, if there are more lessons to be learned, optionally leave them wanting more.
